                all the
                time. Actually, almost 70% of people in Sri Lanka follows Buddhism and most people are intolerant for
                any kind
                of insult of Buddha. Having a Buddha Tattoo is considered as an insult and for this you maybe even sent
                back to
                your country from airport. Although there is no rule for banning Buddha Tattoo in their Constitution,
                but still
                better be on a safer side.</p>

            <p class="lead">Never thought of handwriting being the reason of death right but here is the reality check.
                How many of you can understand a prescription written by a doctor?? I think very few… and just like us
                many other doctors or chemists may not understand the prescription, misunderstands the words and can
                give a different medicine. According to a study, just in US, 7000 people die just because of getting
                wrong medicines due to the sloppy handwriting of the Doctor. So, just imagine what would be the number
                in the world ?
                Just a tip to doctors out there, "Please improve your handwriting you guys".</p>

            <h1>Why Does a Jellyfish Evaporate Under the Sun?</h1>
            <img src="Jellyfish.jpg" alt="..." class="img-thumbnail">
            <p class="lead">You can face a situation where you see a jellyfish on the land and if it's unattended then
                after
                sometimes… Boom !!!! Most of it is gone.

                Jellyfish are mainly made up of water. You can find a jellyfish that is 98% water or at least it will be
                made up of
                95% of water. Now if it is on land, under sun, it will start getting evaporated (it is tendency of water
                to get
                evaporated because of heat).

            <h1>Water makes different sounds as per it's temperature.</h1>
            <img src="waterSound.jpg" alt="..." class="img-thumbnail">
            <p class="lead">The hot water and cold water, both produces a different sound when poured. Ever noticed
                that? I think you haven't. But here I will tell you the reason and you can experiment it at home.

                Basically, the heat changes the thickness or viscosity of the water and that results in the pitch of the
                sound that water produces. Actually the heat comes from the molecules of water moving. In hot water
                molecules moves faster, the thickness is less and makes slightly low-pitched sound whereas cold water is
                thicker a makes a bit high-pitched sound.

            <img src="lauhgter.jpg" alt="..." class="img-thumbnail">
            <p class="lead">According to a neuroscientist "Robert Provine" less than 20% of laughter in the world is
                because of a joke. Isn't it shocking?

                Most of the laughter is a reaction to a general statement such as "What are you doing?" "How have you
                been?" that is followed by a brief laugh just to ensure others. This brief, ensuring laugh helps in
                social bonding too.

            <img src="samsung robot.jpg" alt="..." class="img-thumbnail">
            <p class="lead">Do these interesting facts have you rethinking everything? People stash their phones in
                their back pockets all the time, which is why Samsung created a robot that is shaped like a butt—and
                yes, even wears jeans—to “sit” on their phones to make sure they can take the pressure.</p>

            <img src="peanuts.jpg" alt="..." class="img-thumbnail">
            <p class="lead">They’re legumes. According to Merriam-Webster, a nut is only a nut if it’s “a hard-shelled
                dry fruit or seed with a separable rind or shell and interior kernel.” That means walnuts, almonds,
                cashews, and pistachios aren’t nuts either. They’re seeds.

            <img src="mickey mouse.jpg" alt="..." class="img-thumbnail">
            <p class="lead">Walt Disney might have been the first to put gloves on his characters, as seen in 1929's The
                Opry House starring Mickey Mouse. In addition to being easier to animate, there's another reason Disney
                opted for gloves: “We didn’t want him to have mouse hands because he was supposed to be more human,”
                Disney told his biographer in 1957.</p>

            <p class="lead">The joystick in the 1966 Mercedes F200 showcase car controlled speed and direction,
                replacing both the steering wheel and pedals. The car could also sense which side the driver was sitting
                in, so someone could control it from the passenger seat.
