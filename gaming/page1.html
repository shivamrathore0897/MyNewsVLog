                launch title for the next generation of consoles when they arrive in late 2020. Those who buy Marvel's
                Avengers on PS4 and Xbox One will also receive a free copy on PS5 and Xbox Series X, respectively, if
                they upgrade their consoles. Your profiles and save game progress will transfer seamlessly. The game
                will also support cross-gen play, allowing PS4 and PS5 owners to play together, and the same for those

            <h1>Asus ROG Phone 2 Price in India Increased, Sale to Resume From 22 June 2020 on Flipkart</h1>
            <img src="Asus Rog Phone 2.jpg" alt="..." class="img-thumbnail">
            <p class="lead">Asus ROG Phone 2 is coming back in stock in India, months after its unavailability due to
                the coronavirus outbreak. The gaming phone will be available for purchase in the country through
                Flipkart starting from 22 June 2020, the company said in a press release disseminated on Monday.
                Alongside its comeback, the Asus ROG Phone 2 has received an updated pricing for the base, 8GB RAM
                variant. The ROG Phone 2 was launched in India in September last year. The phone is specially designed
                for mobile games and includes features such as an upgraded ultrasonic Air Triggers 2 as well as stereo
                speakers with DTS:X Ultra support.
                <br>
                The Asus ROG Phone 2 price in India has been hiked to Rs. 39,999 from Rs. 37,999. Asus claimed that the
                new pricing is due to the increase in the GST rates on mobile phones and depreciation of the Indian
                rupee against the US dollar. The new pricing is notably provided for the 8GB RAM + 128GB storage option
                only. However, there are no details about the 12GB RAM + 512GB storage variant that was launched at Rs.
                59,999 and went on sale for the first time in December.

            <img src="cyberpunk 2077.jpg" alt="..." class="img-thumbnail">
            <p class="lead">Cyberpunk 2077 has been delayed again, this time by two months, with CD Projekt Red setting
                a new release date of November 19. The first-person role-playing game's new November slot has sparked
                speculation that it will launch alongside the PS5 and Xbox Series X, slated to arrive in late 2020.
                November is the expected month, giving both next-gen consoles the run into the Western holiday period.
                Moreover, Cyberpunk 2077 was one of the earliest third-party sign-ups for Xbox's Smart Delivery
                programme, and CD Projekt Red has a history of working with Microsoft, so it could even be a launch
                title.
                <br>
                Originally slated for a mid-April release, Cyberpunk 2077 was pushed back five months to September 17
                back in January. Now, three months out from that September release date, CD Projekt Red has driven back
                its next game an additional two months.
                <br>
                Cyberpunk 2077 is out November 19 on PC, PS4, and Xbox One. The game costs Rs. 2,499 on PC, Rs. 3,490 on
                Xbox One, and Rs. 3,499 on PS4.</p>

            <p class="lead">Google Stadia Premier Edition is now cheaper, but users will not get the three free months
                of Stadia Pro unlike earlier. Stadia Pro is a premium subscription service that lets you stream games in
                4K, HDR, and 5.1 surround sound, along with other perks. At the time of release, Google Stadia Premier
                Edition came with Chromecast Ultra HDMI dongle and the Stadia Controller, along with three free months
                of Stadia Pro, all at $129 (roughly Rs. 9,800) in the US, but now, the price has been reduced to $99
                (roughly Rs. 7,500) and the Stadia Pro subscription has been removed.</p>

            <p class="lead">PUBG Mobile, one of the most popular mobile games, is known by this name everywhere except
                in China, where it is called Game for Peace. Notably, there are some other changes between the two
                versions but typically, features that make their way to the Chinese version eventually reach the global
                version as well. With that in mind, the Chinese version of PUBG Mobile has started receiving the much
                anticipated Erangel 2.0 map that is a revamped version of the fan favorite map, Erangel.</p>

            <img src="ps5.jpg" alt="..." class="img-thumbnail">
            <p class="lead">We finally know what the PS5 looks like. At the end of its online PS5 event, Sony unveiled
                its next-generation console — the PlayStation 5 — in all its glory. It's white, it's got wings, and it's
                designed to stand vertically, just like the Xbox Series X. Sony also announced PS5 Digital Edition,
                which will be available at launch and will come without the 4K Blu-ray disc drive. There's no word on
                whether it will cost less or offer more storage space, though hopefully at least one of those will be
                true.
                <br>
                But unlike the Xbox Series X's monolith shape, the PS5 is much sleeker and more fancy. It almost looks
                like a futuristic architectural design for a new-age skyscraper, thanks to the curves and those
                protruding wings at the top. Of course, they have a function too, helping to channel the heat that will
                be produced by the PS5's powerful internals.

            <p class="lead">Spider-Man is coming to PS5. At the online PlayStation 5 event, Sony Interactive
                Entertainment announced Spider-Man: Miles Morales, a launch title for the PS5 and the next entry in the
                Spider-Man series that began with Marvel's Spider-Man in 2018 on the PS4. As you can tell, the
                Spider-Man PS5 game will focus on the eponymous superhero, who was featured in the first game as a
                photographer, was bitten by a genetically-modified spider, gained spider-like powers, and received
                training from Peter Parker.
                <br>
                Spider-Man: Miles Morales was announced with a teaser trailer at the PS5 games event, which featured
                Miles in action in his well-known suit, swinging through New York City and protecting its citizens from
                danger, and walking down the street. The Spider-Man: Miles Morales teaser trailer ended by revealing a
                “Holiday 2020” release date, which puts it alongside the launch of the PS5 in late 2020.</p>

            <h1>Facebook Gaming Rejected by Apple App Store For the Fifth Time</h1>
            <img src="facebook.jpg" alt="..." class="img-thumbnail">
            <p class="lead">Apple has once again rejected Facebook Gaming app on the iOS App Store, as it is a direct
                threat to the Livestream gaming service Apple Arcade. According to the New York Times, this is the fifth
                time Apple has decided to reject the Facebook Gaming app.
                <br>
                Facebook team is not surprised by Apple's decision, as they have been trying to launch the Facebook
                Gaming app on the App Store unsuccessfully since February. "Games are by far the most lucrative category
                of mobile apps worldwide. Apple's App Store, the only officially approved place for iPhone and iPad
                users to find new games and other programs, generated about $15 billion in revenue last year," said the
                report.
                <br>
                Apple claims that the App Store rules do not allow third-party apps to distribute games as a separate
                platform. The tech giant apparently doesn't want its own App Store and Apple Arcade business to be
                affected by allowing Facebook Gaming on its App Store.

            <h1>Is PUBG a Chinese App?</h1>
            <img src="pubg mobile.jpg" alt="..." class="img-thumbnail">
            <p class="lead">After clashes between Indian and Chinese troops in the Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh on
                Monday night led to the deaths of twenty of our soldiers, desi Twitter has been on the warpath. Their
                weapon? Ban and boycott anything that is Chinese.
                <br>
                For the past few days, Indians have called on their brethren to boycott everything, from Chinese food to
                TikTok, from Chinese smartphones to even TVs made in China. All in the name of nationalism and
                patriotism.
                <br>
                Trends on social media show that people are uninstalling their favourite online game, PUBG too. But is
                PUBG really from China?
                <br>
                Here's the truth....
                <br>
                A battle royale game that promises the winner a highly coveted Chicken dinner, The PlayerUnknown’s
                Battlegrounds or PUBG was developed by a man named Brendan Greene, who hails from Ireland. Now PUBG for
                desktops was developed by a South Korean gaming company named Bluehole.
                <br>
                However, in 2017, there were reports that the game could get banned in China because it was too violent
                and bloody and went against the cultural values of the country. In fact, the government offered PUBG
                lovers a state-approved alternative of the game, Force for Peace.
                <br>
                This is where Chinese company Tencent stepped in.
                <br>
                Tencent Games, which was part of Chinese conglomerate Tencent Holdings, offered to develop a mobile
                version of the game, PUBG Mobile, after changing the format a bit. Soon after the India-China face off,
                Indians also googled to see how much of PUBG Tencent actually owns, in an attempt to understand exactly
                how Chinese the game is. For those wondering, Tencent has a 10% stakehold in Bluehole.
                <br>
                Tencent had rolled out a preliminary version of the game to test it on players and BBC reports that
                already 70 million people had gotten their hands on it. Although PUBG Mobile was a hit in China, Tencent
                did not get approval from the government.</p>
