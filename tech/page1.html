            <img src="apple watch.jpg" alt="..." class="img-thumbnail">
            <p class="lead">We knew smart wearables and fitness watches will soon be the guiding light, on a daily
                basis, for a lot of us. That perhaps starts now, with the Apple Watch now detecting, monitoring and
                admonishing or congratulating you depending on how well you do the simple task of washing your hands.
                One would assume that you may have been washing your hands for years now, but the thing is, a lot of us
                don’t do it well enough. With the watchOS 7 update that rolls out later this year, the Apple Watch will
                get the ability to detect and monitor the time you spend washing your hands, complete with a timer
                telling you how many seconds of washing remain. Apple is calling this Automatic Hand Washing Detection.
                This is a great habit to inculcate if you haven’t already, perhaps with the COVID scare a very real
                thing.</p>

            <p class="lead">
                OnePlus is all set to launch its affordable OnePlus TV series in India on July 2. If reports are to be
                believed, the company is also working on a new smartphone that might be called OnePlus Z or OnePlus
                Nord. In fact, OnePlus co-founder Pete Lau and top executive Carl Pei both took on Twitter to tease the
                upcoming launch with the hashtag #NewBeginnings.
                <br>
                Both Lau and Pei haven't revealed anything and remain tight-lipped so there is no clarity if the teasers
                are indeed for the OnePlus Z or OnePlus Nord. But given the fact that there have been numerous rumours
                that the company is working on an affordable smartphone series, the OnePlus Z could finally see the
                light of the day.

            <img src="india flag.jpg" alt="..." class="img-thumbnail">
            <p class="lead">India has joined the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI) as a founding
                member, in a bid to promote joint governmental initiatives around the development of artificial
                intelligence (AI), and its implementation in everyday affairs. The GPAI initiative includes Australia,
                Canada, the European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea,
                United Kingdom and United States of America, alongside India. The body will be supported by a
                Secretariat hosted at the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris, France, and
                have two ‘Centres of Expertise’ – one in Montreal, Canada, and the other in Paris.
                <br>
                According to a media release, India’s involvement with the GPAI will work to “guide the responsible
                development and use of AI, grounded in human rights, inclusion, diversity, innovation, and economic
                growth.” GPAI will also focus on promoting the practical use of AI and not just research in theory, with
                the eventual goal of nurturing AI applications in various fields. The body will facilitate the coming
                together of industry stakeholders, government bodies, civil groups and academic professionals, in order
                to create new applications of AI that can be implemented in real life.</p>

                months, or Rs 999 per year if they want access to premium content. Until yesterday the service was

            <p class="lead">Video conferencing platform Zoom has said it will be providing end-to-end encryption to all
                users, reversing its earlier decision to offer the privacy feature only to paid users. The announcement
                came after digital right group criticised Zoom for its plan to deprive free users of the benefits of
                end-to-end encryption. The decision to exclude free users was based on fear of misuse of the platform by
                bad actors, according to Zoom.
                <br>
                In a blog post on Wednesday, Zoom CEO Eric Yuan said that the company has now identified a path forward
                that balances the legitimate right of all users to privacy and the safety of users on its platform.
                "This will enable us to offer E2EE (end-to-end encryption) as an advanced add-on feature for all of our
                users around the globe -- free and paid -- while maintaining the ability to prevent and fight abuse on
                our platform," Yuan said.

            </h1>
            <img src="google ban apps.jpg" alt="..." class="img-thumbnail">
            <p class="lead">Google has reportedly removed 30 apps from the Play Store for pushing unwanted ads and
                intrusive browser redirects to users without them even clicking on a link. While the apps have been
                removed, security researchers at WhiteOps have issued a warning asking Android users to uninstall them
                in case they have installed any of them on the smartphone in the past.
                <br>
                These apps were specifically designed to target the beauty and selfie market and were uploaded to
                Google’s app store starting in January 2019. Notably, Google’s security service on the Play Store had
                identified these apps and were deleted only a few weeks after they rolled out. However, in the 17 days
                of their existence on the Play Store, these apps were downloaded over 5,00,000 times.
                <br>
                Here is the list of apps that you should delete from your Android devices

            <h1>Huawei's Equipment Will Not be Used For Mobile Networks in India</h1>
            <img src="huawei ban.jpg" alt="..." class="img-thumbnail">
            <p class="lead">In the midst of the ongoing military dispute and the border skirmishes with China, the
                Government of India sources have confirmed that the Department of Telecom has asked BSNL not to use
                Chinese equipment manufacturer’s gear in the upgradation of its 4G mobile networks in the country. The
                DoT is also going to rework the 4G telecom equipment tender floated by state-run Bharat Sanchar Nigam
                Ltd. (BSNL) and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd. (MTNL), in order to keep the Chinese company out. India
                on Wednesday told China that its attack on Indian soldiers at Galwan Valley was 'pre-meditated' and
                there will be 'consequences'.
                <br>
                It is also believed that the DoT wants private mobile service providers to avoid using network equipment
                made by Huawei and ZTE. It is believed that persistent reports of security concerns with network
                equipment manufactured by Huawei, which is believed to enable the Chinese government to snoop in, also
                played a role in these decisions. There will be a requirement for private mobile companies to also
                reduce the usage of existing Huawei equipment, if any, gradually. Govt sources also say that the
                security features and ownership pattern of HUAWEI and ZTE are a sticking point in India’s network
                upgradation plans.</p>
